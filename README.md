# serverUtils
Java 1.21.5 Paper plugin that has random server utilities and random commands.

## How to use
### Join Messages
You can use /setjoinmessagecontent <message> to create a message when the player joins the game. But you have to also enable joinmessage for this to show up. You can enable it with /setjoinmessage on

### Time & Weather fixer
/tw allows you to change the time to day and the weather to clear in your current world.

### TomMustBe12 and Rysterio commands
Yeah uh I added these for fun lol, they aren't removable but in future versions I might make it optional or just remove them entirely. This was my first plugin so that's why I added it.

## bruh
I kinda named it JoinMessage before I wanted to call serverUtils, but whatever lol. thats why source is weird folder name. Sorry.
